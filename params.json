{"name":"Svn info","tagline":"svn subversion graph stats","body":"A web based interface to look at your subversion history.\r\nProvides the following graphs\r\n* Important words used in commits based on term frequency\r\n* Punch card (Day vs Hour of day, cell value = number of commits)\r\n* Monthwise number of commits\r\n* Monthwise files modified\r\n* A co-author graph (People who have worked on similar files more number of times are closer)\r\n\r\nIf the user is 'all' at certain path in the repo, the following extra graph is displayed\r\n* Pie chart of the contribution by the user\r\n\r\n### Pre-Requisites\r\n* Apache\r\n* PHP\r\n* MYSQL\r\n* Internet access for generating charts\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to run:\r\n\r\n\r\n# Step1: Populating data\r\n* Create a verbose svn log of your repository and call it 'svn_log_verbose_to_add.xml'\r\n  eg: svn log -v --xml > svn_log_verbose_to_add.xml\r\n\r\n* Create a schema in mysql called svn_analysis\r\n  Import the queries in svn_analysis.sql. This will create couple of tables\r\n\r\n* Modify the mysql host, username and password in the file parse.php. The user account used must have write permissions to svn_analysis schema.\r\n\r\n* run parse.php. This will populate the data from svn_log_verbose_to_add.xml to svn_analysis schema. Depending on the number of commits, this might take a while.\r\n\r\n# Step2: Running\r\n\r\n* Modify the mysql host, username and password in the file data/db.php. The user account used must have read permissions to svn_analysis schema created.\r\n\r\n* Whole folder of svn_analysis should be under doc root for apache. Create an alias in apache to point <host>/svn_analysis to this directory. index.php is the main page.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n* Incremental svn logs addition\r\n* Use a JavaScript based charting library\r\n* Read the db credentials from a properties file for both data store and display\r\n* Use a word cloud for display of commit words. Also use stemmers and a better stop word removal.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
